copy-file-stats
===============

copy-file-stats is a small program to "copy" file stats from one files in one
directory and its subdirectories to another directory and its subdirectories.
The program works on Linux (or similar POSIX-compatible OS) only, no Windows
port.

The "stats" mean file ownership (both user and group) and/or permissions.
The program expects three parameters: path to the source directory and path of the
destination directory, in that order. Third parameter should be either
--dry-run or --force, depending on whether you just want to show, what would be
changed or whether you want to perform those changes.

After copy-file-stats is done, files in the destination directory will have the
same owner and permissions as the corresponding files in the source directory.
This basically requires that source and destination directory have more or less
the same file and directory structure. Files that are present in the source
directory but not in the destination directory will not be touched. The same
applies to files that are present in the destination but not in the source
directory.

copy-file-stats is a command-line only program. There is no GUI, because I did
not need a GUI.


Command line options:
---------------------

copy-file-stats supports several command line options.


copy-file-stats [options] SOURCE_DIR DESTINATION_DIR

  --help           - displays a help message and quits
  -?               - same as --help
  --version        - displays the version of the programme and quits
  -v               - same as --version
  --silent         - produces less output about ongoing changes
  --no-ownership   - do not change file ownership
  --no-chown       - alias for --no-ownership
  --no-permissions - do not change file permissions
  --no-chmod       - alias for --no-permissions
  --dry-run, -n    - only show what would be done, but don't do it
  --simulate, -s   - alias for --dry-run
  --force, -f      - force change of file permissions and/or ownership.
                     Either -f or -n have to be given to run this programme.
  SOURCE_DIR       - set source directory (i.e. reference directory) to
                     SOURCE_DIR
  DESTINATION_DIR  - set destination directory to DESTINATION_DIR



Build copy-file-stats from source:
----------------------------------

The source repository of copy-file-stats contains a CMakeLists.txt file that
is suitable for use with CMake. CMake version 2.4 or later should be sufficient
to build the program, but it has only been tested with CMake 2.8.
To build the program, just type the following two commands in the directory
that contains the source code:

    cmake ./
    make

If you prefer an "out of source" build, you can create a build directory and
then do the same, e.g.:

    mkdir ./build
    cd ./build
    cmake ../
    make

This should do the trick, as long as CMake and a C++ compiler are installed on
your machine. Any recent (and not so recent) C++ compiler should work, because
copy-file-stats does NOT use any language constructs from C++11 or C++14.
