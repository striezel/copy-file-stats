/* Covered functions in test:
   This program tests the function SaveRestore::restore() and its ability to
   restore file stats from a given "stat file".
   Afterwards, the current stats are written to another stat file, which is
   then compared against a reference file to verify that the produced file
   matches the expected result and thus the SaveRestore::restore() function did
   its job as expected.
   The comparison is performed by a Bash script: stat-file-test.sh. This script
   is also used to set up the files and directories and their permissions
   (with the help of chown) for this test.
